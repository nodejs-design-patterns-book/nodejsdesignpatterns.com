question: 'Is there a community or support group I can join?'
---

Yes! You can join the discussion and connect with other readers through the book’s official **[GitHub Discussions community](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Node.js-Design-Patterns-Fourth-Edition/discussions)**.

It’s a great space to **ask questions**, **share your solutions to the exercises**, **get feedback**, and **learn from others** who are also working through the book. Whether you're stuck on a pattern or just curious how others approached a challenge, the community is there to help.
