question: 'What tools or frameworks are used in the examples?'
---

The book primarily focuses on **JavaScript and Node.js core APIs** to teach you the fundamentals of building high-quality backend applications. This includes deep coverage of modules, streams, events, async patterns, and other native capabilities.

Beyond the core, you'll also get hands-on experience with a wide range of **production-grade tools and frameworks**, including:

- **Level** for modular key-value storage and plugin systems
- **Consul** for service discovery in dynamic infrastructure
- **ZeroMQ**, **RabbitMQ**, and **Redis Streams** for messaging and distributed communication
- **SQLite** for lightweight persistent storage
- **Playwright** for robust end-to-end testing
- The **Node.js built-in test runner** for unit and integration tests

These tools are introduced contextually, when they make the most sense, so you can learn how to integrate them thoughtfully into your architecture, **without overwhelming abstraction or unnecessary complexity**.
