question: 'What are the main topics I will learn in this book?'

This book will teach you how to write **robust, scalable, and maintainable Node.js applications** by covering a wide range of topics, including:

- **The Node.js runtime and event loop**, so you can understand how Node.js handles asynchronous operations and why it's great for I/O-heavy applications.
- **Modern module systems** with a focus on **ECMAScript Modules (ESM)**, helping you avoid import/export pitfalls and confidently structure modular code.
- **Asynchronous programming** using **callbacks**, **promises**, and **async/await**, along with control flow patterns to avoid callback hell and write predictable, clean code.
- **Streams in Node.js**, including how to process large data flows efficiently using **stream pipelines**, **backpressure**, and **composability**.
- **Design patterns**, including classic **creational**, **structural**, and **behavioral patterns** reimagined for JavaScript and Node.js, like Factory, Singleton, Strategy, and Middleware.
- **Testing strategies**, from **unit** to **integration** to **end-to-end tests**, including practical advice on using tools like **Playwright** and the built-in **Node.js test runner**.
- **Advanced recipes** for solving real-world problems such as **caching**, **batching**, **async initialization**, and **offloading CPU-bound work**.
- **Scalability patterns**, including **clustering**, **Docker/Kubernetes deployment**, **service discovery**, and strategies for splitting monoliths into **microservices**.
- **Messaging and integration patterns**, covering **Pub/Sub**, **task queues**, and **service communication** with tools like **ZeroMQ**, **RabbitMQ**, and **Redis Streams**.

By the end of the book, you'll be able to design, build, and operate Node.js systems that are **clean**, **efficient**, and **production-grade**, using patterns that **scale with your team and your traffic**.
