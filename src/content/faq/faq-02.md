question: 'I am new to JavaScript and Node.js, is this book for me?'
---

This book assumes that you have an **intermediate understanding of JavaScript**, **web application development**, **databases**, and **software design principles**. If you are **new to JavaScript**, but **familiar with other languages and technologies**, this book can still be a **valuable resource** for you, but we do recommend you to **get familiar with the basics of JavaScript first**. Some good **FREE resources** you could check out are [**Eloquent JavaScript**](https://eloquentjavascript.net/), [**JavaScript introduction by W3C**](https://www.edx.org/course/javascript-introduction), and [**JavaScript in 30 days**](https://www.javascript30.com/).
