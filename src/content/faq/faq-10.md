question: 'What are some examples of real-life applications that are presented in the book?'

_Node.js Design Patterns_ includes a wide range of **real-life projects** designed to help you apply new concepts and patterns in practical scenarios. You'll build a **website spider and downloader**, a **streaming file archive pipeline**, a **plugin system for Level**, a **dynamic HTTP load balancer using Consul**, a **peer-to-peer network for web services**, and a **distributed real-time chat application** powered by **ZeroMQ**, **RabbitMQ**, and **Redis Streams**. The book also guides you through building a **worker pool for background job execution** and includes a complete **testing setup** with **unit tests**, **integration tests** using the **Node.js built-in test runner**, and **end-to-end tests** using **Playwright**. These examples are crafted to reflect real-world needs and give you the confidence to build production-ready applications.
