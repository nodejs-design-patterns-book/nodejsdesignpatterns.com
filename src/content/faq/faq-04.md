question: 'Can I download Node.js Design Patterns for FREE?'
---

**No.** _Node.js Design Patterns_ is the result of **years of hard work** by the authors, reviewers, and publishing team at Packt, and we believe its **price is fair given the depth, quality, and practicality** of the content it offers.

That said, we understand you may want to try before you buy. You can [**download Chapter 6: Coding with Streams for FREE**](#free-chapter) to get a feel for the book’s **style, structure, and hands-on approach**.

You can also explore **all the code examples for FREE** on the book’s [**official GitHub repository**](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Node.js-Design-Patterns-fourth-Edition).
