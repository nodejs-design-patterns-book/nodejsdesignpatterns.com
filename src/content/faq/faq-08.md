question: 'How up to date is this book?'
---

This is the **fourth edition** of the book, fully updated as of **Node.js 24**. It reflects the **latest features of the Node.js core library**, along with **modern JavaScript syntax** such as **ECMAScript Modules (ESM)** and **async/await**.

We’ve also included an **entire chapter dedicated to testing**, where you'll learn how to write robust test suites using the **Node.js built-in test runner**: no external frameworks required.

While the content is aligned with the most recent version of Node.js, we strongly believe that **most of the patterns, principles, and practices explored in the book are timeless**. Even if you're reading this **5 or 10 years after its release**, we’re confident you’ll still find **tons of practical, real-world value** to help you build better Node.js applications. In fact, **many of the techniques in the book are broadly applicable to web development and application design in general**, even if you're working in **other languages or frameworks**.
