With **80 pages** of content, it’s packed with **real-world examples**, **advanced streaming techniques**, and **performance-oriented patterns**. Many readers have told us this is their **favorite chapter** in the entire book, and we hope it gives you a strong sense of the **depth, clarity, and practical value** we’ve worked so hard to deliver throughout the entire book.
