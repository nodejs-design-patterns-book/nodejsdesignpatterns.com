question: 'Does this book cover TypeScript?'
---

Yes and No!

This is **not a TypeScript book**, and that’s **by design**.

Our goal is to help you master the **core fundamentals of Node.js and JavaScript** first. TypeScript is a powerful abstraction, but it’s still just that: an abstraction. We believe that having a strong foundation in the underlying language and runtime is essential before layering on additional complexity.

That said, everything you learn in this book is **fully compatible with TypeScript**. You can **easily add TypeScript on top** of the patterns and practices you’ll learn, or stick to **plain JavaScript** if that’s what you prefer. Either way, the skills you gain will remain **highly relevant and easy to apply**.

And while this isn't a TypeScript-focused book, this **fourth edition** includes **practical references to TypeScript throughout**, including **tips, integration strategies, and guidance on when and how TypeScript can provide additional safety and clarity** in real-world projects.
