question: 'What are all the patterns discussed in the book?'
---

The central part of the book covers both **classic design patterns** from the _Gang of Four_ and **patterns tailored to JavaScript and Node.js**.

Here’s a breakdown of all the patterns you'll learn:

**Creational Patterns**

- **Factory**
- **Builder**
- **Revealing Constructor**
- **Singleton**
- **Dependency Injection**

**Structural Patterns**

- **Proxy**
- **Decorator**
- **Adapter**

**Behavioral Patterns**

- **Strategy**
- **State**
- **Command**
- **Template**
- **Iterator**, including **Generators** and **Async Iterators**
- **Middleware**

In addition to these, the book also introduces **JavaScript- and Node.js-specific patterns and best practices** throughout, in the context of each relevant topic. This ensures you're not just learning abstract theory — you're gaining **practical, production-ready skills** and a deep understanding of **how to build real-world Node.js systems with confidence**.
