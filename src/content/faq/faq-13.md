question: 'I already own a previous edition. Should I get this one?'

If you already own the **third edition**, the **fourth edition** brings **a wealth of new content and improvements** that make it well worth the upgrade.

It features a **refined structure**, clearer explanations, and **expanded coverage** on key topics like **testing**, **scalability**, and **system architecture**. There's a brand-new chapter dedicated to **testing**, which includes practical strategies for writing **unit tests**, **integration tests** with the **Node.js built-in test runner**, and **end-to-end tests** using **Playwright**.

You’ll also find **updated code examples** that reflect **modern JavaScript syntax**, plus contextual references to **TypeScript**, making it easy to adapt the patterns even if you’re working in a typed environment.

We’ve added **new insights on security best practices**, so you can build applications that are not only scalable but also robust and safe. And throughout the book, you’ll find **real stories and hard-earned lessons from the authors' professional experience**, offering a more personal and practical perspective on how these patterns apply in real-world projects.

In short, this edition is **not just an update**: it’s a serious upgrade for developers who want to stay at the forefront of Node.js development.
