question: 'How long does it take to complete the book?'
---

This book is **not designed to be rushed through**. While it's structured to build your knowledge incrementally, from fundamentals to advanced concepts, it's important to **take your time** and **digest each section thoroughly**, especially if you're serious about applying what you learn in real-world projects.

Your reading speed will naturally depend on your **existing experience with JavaScript and Node.js**, and on how much time you choose to spend **exploring the examples, reflecting on the concepts, and working through the exercises**.

Some readers complete the book in a few weeks, others take months. But the real value isn’t just in reading it once.

This book was also designed to serve as a **timeless reference**: something you can return to whenever you need a **refresher**, a **code example**, or **guidance** on a topic you’re currently tackling at work or in a personal project. It’s not just a read-through book. It’s a resource you’ll want to **keep close by**.
