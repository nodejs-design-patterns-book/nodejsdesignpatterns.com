Node.js Design Patterns is a must-read, **an excellent resource for learning how to build Node.js applications**. I loved the fact that you can actually learn new stuff regardless your experience. My favorite chapters are about scaling a production application (Universal JavaScript, Scalability and Architectural Patterns, Advanced Recipes)... and the coding samples are also available for free on GitHub!
