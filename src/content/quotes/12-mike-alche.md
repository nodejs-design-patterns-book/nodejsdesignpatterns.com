Every time a new Node.js book comes out I read it. I think there isn’t a single one that I haven’t read. And out of all of them I must say that Node.js Design Patterns is by far —and I mean it BY FAR— the undisputed best. To put it in the most honest way possible: this is **the book I go to read when preparing to teach a Node.js class to groups of software engineers**.
