I have "Node.js Design Patterns" always at hand both when I start quick new projects and when the time comes to refactor the larger and mature ones. It's **an invaluable and well-structured source of patterns, best practices, and guidelines**. Also, it’s always good to know that particular features are in use in well-known projects - thanks to the “In the wild” section.
