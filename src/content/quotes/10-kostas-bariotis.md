Node.js Design Patterns is **an amazing resource for every level of Node.js developers**. It covers important design patterns that are used in the Node.js world (modules, callbacks, asynchronous code, etc.) and explores critical bits of the core library (promises, streams, event emitters, etc.). Finally, it provides best practices on running Node.js as part of a bigger architecture where you need to horizontally scale an application, balance the incoming load and set up a message bus in between your services.
