I am a hardcore techie, big into Node.js and I have to say I have learned a lot by just going through Node.js Design Patterns. The level of detail and quality of the examples are incredible and in general, it is **a good book have as a reference to solve any problem that might arise while coding** (not only in Node.js). This is **a book I recommend to my students to go from 0 to hero and keep it as a reference forever**. The previous edition was good, but this one is just out of this world.
