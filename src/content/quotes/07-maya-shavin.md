This book surprised me for how detailed it is! It contains a lot of useful and easy-to-understand information. For someone familiar with the Node.js, I'm intrigued by how much depth the book provides in working with Node.js. **Every topic is approached in a very straightforward way**: while being practical, this book offers different readers' levels - from the most juniors to the experienced ones - **an excellent reference to apply design patterns in any real scale Node.js application**. Totally going to bookmark it as my favorite Node.js book!
