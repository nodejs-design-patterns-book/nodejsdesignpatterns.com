I've read basically every Node.js book ever published, and this is my personal favorite (and best) by far. Even months after reading all the way through this text, I still learn new things each time I browse through it.
What can I say, **this is a must for anyone writing code in Node.js**. Everything in the book, including the code examples, are very useful in practice.
