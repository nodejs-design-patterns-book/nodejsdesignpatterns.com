Wow! This book ... is amazing. After many years of programming with JavaScript, I still have learned so much from this book. It covers many topics relevant to large Node.js applications with ease, with many relevant code snippets making the material easily approachable. While not for beginners, it is **a great book for anyone looking to take their JS applications to the higher level**.
