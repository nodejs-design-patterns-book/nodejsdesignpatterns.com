Callbacks got you this far, but now it’s time to take the next step. In this
chapter, you'll learn how **Promises** and **async/await** make asynchronous
code easier to read, write, and reason about. You’ll start by mastering how
promises work under the hood, then build up to async/await, exploring real-world
patterns, gotchas like the `"return await"` trap, and how to handle errors
properly. If you’ve ever written async code that felt buggy or unpredictable,
this chapter will help you untangle that complexity and write code that’s both
clean and robust.
