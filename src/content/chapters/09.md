Behavioral patterns are all about **how objects interact and behave over time**.
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to design applications that can **adapt**,
**respond to change**, and **compose logic cleanly**. From the **Strategy
pattern** for swapping out behaviors, to **State machines**, **Generators and
Async Iterators**, and even **Middleware pipelines**, this chapter explores some
of the most useful patterns for structuring logic in a way that’s modular and
maintainable. You'll also see how Node.js takes a unique, more expressive
approach to patterns that are typically rigid in other languages.
