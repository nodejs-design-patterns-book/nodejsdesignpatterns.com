Creating objects in JavaScript can feel anything but straightforward. With no
classes in the traditional sense and multiple ways to structure code, applying
design patterns isn’t always clear-cut. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to
implement classic **creational patterns**, including **Factory**, **Builder**,
**Revealing Constructor**, **Singleton**, and **Dependency Injection**, in a way
that fits naturally within Node.js. These patterns will help you simplify object
creation, enforce clean boundaries, and build systems that are easier to extend
and maintain.
