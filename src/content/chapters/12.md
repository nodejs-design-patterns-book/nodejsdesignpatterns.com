Node.js was born with scalability in mind, but writing scalable applications
takes more than just picking the right runtime. In this chapter, you'll learn
how to **design for scale** by combining proven architectural patterns with
Node.js-specific techniques.

Weâ€™ll explore the **Scale Cube** as a framework to break down scalability
challenges, and walk through techniques like **clustering**, **load balancing**,
and **service discovery**. You'll also learn how to use **Docker** and
**Kubernetes** to deploy modern resilient systems, and how to split a growing
monolith into well-structured **microservices**.

This chapter gives you the mindset and tools to scale not just your
applications, but your own skills as a developer ready to take on real-world
traffic and team-scale complexity.
