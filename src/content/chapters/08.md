Structural patterns are about **how your code fits together**. In this chapter,
you’ll learn how to use patterns like **Proxy**, **Decorator**, and **Adapter**
to write code that’s cleaner, more flexible, and easier to maintain. You’ll see
how to dynamically extend objects, intercept behaviors, and adapt interfaces
using real-world examples from the Node.js ecosystem, including LevelDB and
reactive programming techniques. These are powerful tools for organizing
complexity without sacrificing clarity.
