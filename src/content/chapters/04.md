Struggling with deeply nested callbacks, unpredictable execution order, or race
conditions? You're not alone. Writing clean and reliable asynchronous code in
Node.js can be challenging, especially when simple tasks like running operations
in sequence or in parallel turn into spaghetti code. This chapter helps you
manage that complexity with proven **control flow patterns**, from **sequential
execution** to **concurrent execution** and even **limited concurrent
execution**. You'll learn how to recognize and avoid **callback hell**, apply
**best practices**, and write code thatâ€™s both efficient and maintainable.
