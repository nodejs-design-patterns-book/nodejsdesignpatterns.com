Streams are one of the most powerful but misunderstood features in Node.js. Many
developers avoid them because they seem low-level or too complex, but avoiding
streams can lead to brittle, memory-hungry code that’s hard to scale. In this
chapter, you’ll learn how to **use, compose, and create streams** with
confidence. We'll start with the fundamentals and then dive into advanced
patterns like **concurrent processing**, **backpressure handling**, and **stream
pipelines**. Along the way, you’ll see how streams can make your code more
**performant**, **memory-efficient**, and **elegant**, especially when working
with large or continuous flows of data.
