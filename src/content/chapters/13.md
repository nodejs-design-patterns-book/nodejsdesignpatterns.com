Scaling a system across multiple services is only half the battle, making those
services **talk to each other reliably** is what turns a distributed system into
a robust architecture. In this final chapter, you’ll learn how to implement the
**messaging and integration patterns** that make scalable systems work.

We’ll explore the fundamentals of messaging, including **one-way and
request/reply communication**, **event and command messages**, and **brokered vs
peer-to-peer topologies**. Then we’ll get hands-on with messaging tools like
**ZeroMQ**, **RabbitMQ (AMQP)**, and **Redis Streams**, and apply patterns such
as **Publish/Subscribe**, **Task Distribution**, and **Correlation Identifiers**
to build real-world Node.js applications that are resilient, decoupled, and
production-ready.

This chapter brings everything together (architecture, design patterns, async
mastery, and scalability) into one of the most practical and impactful skills in
modern software development: integration.
