Even experienced Node.js developers eventually run into edge cases that aren’t
easy to solve with out-of-the-box tools. In this chapter, we take a
**recipe-driven approach** to tackle some of the trickiest problems you'll face
in production. From **asynchronously initialized components** to **request
batching and caching**, from **canceling async operations** to **handling
CPU-bound tasks**, we show you proven patterns and techniques to write robust,
scalable solutions.

Each recipe is based on real-world needs and comes with practical code you can
adapt to your own applications. You’ll also learn how to choose between
**interleaving** tasks, **worker threads**, and **external processes** when
offloading CPU-intensive work, ensuring your app stays fast and responsive no
matter what’s thrown at it.
