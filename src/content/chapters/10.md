Testing is more than just a safety net: it’s a mindset. In this chapter, you’ll
learn the philosophy behind effective software testing and why it’s essential
for building reliable, maintainable applications. We’ll explore the three main
types of tests: **unit tests** for verifying individual pieces of logic,
**integration tests** for ensuring components work together correctly, and
**end-to-end (E2E) tests** for validating the full user experience.

You’ll also learn how to structure your tests, isolate dependencies using **test
doubles**, and take full advantage of the **Node.js built-in test runner**. From
basic assertions to browser automation with **Playwright**, this chapter gives
you the tools and patterns to test with confidence and build software that
lasts.
