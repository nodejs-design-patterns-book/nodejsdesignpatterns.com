Ever felt overwhelmed by asynchronous code that’s hard to follow or debug? This
chapter gives you the foundation you need to make sense of Node.js’s core async
patterns. You'll learn how **callbacks** really work, how to avoid common
mistakes like **Zalgo** and **uncaught exceptions**, and how to write
predictable async code. We’ll also introduce the **Observer pattern** and
**EventEmitter**, two powerful tools for reacting to asynchronous events. If
you’ve ever wondered why your asynchronous code behaves unpredictably, this
chapter will help you untangle the mess and build confidence.
