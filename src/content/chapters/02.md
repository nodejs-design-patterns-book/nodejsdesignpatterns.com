Whether you're just getting started or have been using Node.js for years,
chances are you've run into **import/export errors**, struggled with **ESM vs
CommonJS**, or felt lost in a sea of **module resolution issues**. In this
chapter, we break down the Node.js **module system**, with a clear focus on
**ECMAScript modules (ESM)**, the modern standard for writing modular
JavaScript. You'll learn how to use ESM effectively in Node.js, understand its
quirks, and see how it differs from CommonJS. We’ll also cover
**interoperability** between the two systems and how **TypeScript** fits into
the picture. If you’ve ever been frustrated by modules that just won’t load,
this chapter is for you.
