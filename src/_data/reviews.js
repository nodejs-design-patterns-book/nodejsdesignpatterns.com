    title: 'Extremely helpful',
    text: 'From the title, the book sounded like it would be exactly what I needed and I am happy to say it is. There are always several ways of doing things and the pitfalls/best practices (and reasons behind them) are not always immediately obvious. This book gives you the tools to reason about which pattern is going to be best for a certain task, which is so helpful. I really appreciate the quality of the resource. They also provide exercises at the end of the chapter which I think is super helpful for reinforcing concepts and keeping things interactive.'

    title: 'Highly recommend to add this to your toolkit if you\'re developing Node.js applications',
    text: 'I\'ve been developing for Node.js for a number of years, and this book helps me to understand concepts and things under the hood I’ve never had a chance to explore, all in a single source. I’m amazed that design patterns are covered with JS codes, as it shows me how to design and architect Node applications better to run at scale. Another thing I love is the hands-on aspects in guiding me to set up and run production-grade services such as task distribution, callbacks, concurrency and streams. Highly recommend to add this to your toolkit if you\'re developing Node.js applications.'
