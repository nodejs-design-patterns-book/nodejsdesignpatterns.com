    What can I say, this is a must for anyone writing code in Node. js. Everything in the book, including the code examples, are very useful in practice.`

For someone familiar with the Node.js, I\'m intrigued by how much depth the book provides in working with Node.js. Every topic is approached in a very straightforward way: while being practical, this book offers different readers\' levels - from the most juniors to the experienced ones - an excellent reference to apply design patterns in any real scale Node.js application. Totally going to bookmark it as my favorite Node.js book!'

It covers important design patters that are used in the Node.js world (modules, callbacks, asynchronicity, etc) and explores critical bits of the core library (promises, streams, event emitters, etc). Finally, it provides best practices on running Node.js as part of a bigger architecture where you need to horizontally scale an application, balance the incoming load and setup a message bus in between your services.'

This is a book I recommend to my students to go from 0 to hero and keep it as a reference forever. The previous edition was good, but this one is just out of this world.'

As a full-stack developer focused on the front-end, I especially enjoyed a chapter about universal JavaScript.'
